# Backend (clients.exordium.org)

## Prelude

Exordium is a virtual private networking software in the works. Our goal is to donate all profits made from the VPN towards environmental protection, and to fight against the climate crisis.

We hope to share as much of our programming as open source code to help others create their own projects and further the development of software built with electronjs and nodejs, which are the fundamental pieces to us.

## Revisions

At first the Exordium website had the frontend and backend combined into one design. However, after we began exeeding the max recommended file sizes in the compiled versions, we decided it would be smart to seperate the backend and frontend, also with much more cusotmizable designs and workspaces that we needed. 

If you don't already know, Exordium is a virtual private networking software in the works, and has been in the works for about a year and a half at the time of this README being created.

This project has gone through multiple variations. First we started with Wordpress, realized that it would make more sense for us to mold all our softwares and platforms into the same languages. The Exordium desktop application is being created in electron, while the mobile applications are using the ionic framework, which is an extension of Angular. 

All in all, it makes more sense to keep all our platforms as close as possible, and that is why we have seen so many different test versions of each part of the project. I am sorry that these variations happen so often, but I believe we are on the right track now, and closer then ever to finally completing this project to some degree and having a service to give to the public. 

## Website

The Exordium VPN website can be found at; https://exordium.org. 

## API

The API we use for the website, desktop and mobile apps can also be found under our exordium-dev github organisation, please feel free to check it out and understand how our system works. 

## Issues and Suggestions

None of the project I develop will ever be perfect, and so that is why I am always looking for beta testers and the general public to help with testing and suggesting. Feel free to open an issue for either :) We also have a discord if you would like faster responses!
